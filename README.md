## Conflict Plan

**What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**  

Bring up any issues in the group slack or talk to someone one-on-one if needed. Open lines of communication. Everyone is learning and be understanding of that. If anyone is having issues solving things alone we can use partner programming or sharing screens to figure it out together.  

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**  
Let them know to delegate tasks more and that they're taking over a bit too much. It's a team effort.  

**How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?** 

Everyone is learning and be understanding of that. If anyone is having issues solving things alone we can use partner programming or sharing screens to figure it out together. People choosing tasks that they are comfortable with, don't necessarily have to complete an equal amount.  

**How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**  

Offer to help or change the way were programming together. Don't call them out in the group setting, just offer to help out if you notice something or talk it over with the person.

Team meeting/ intervention.
